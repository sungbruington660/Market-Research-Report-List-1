<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adhesion Barriers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Film</li><li>Gel</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adhesion barriers are materials used to prevent the formation of unwanted adhesions between tissues after surgeries. The market is categorized into three main types: films, gels, and liquids. Film barriers are thin, flexible layers that provide a protective coating over tissues. Gel barriers offer a more viscous consistency, allowing for better diffusion and adherence to surfaces. Liquid barriers are typically applied in a fluid state, conforming to the tissue contours and creating a protective layer. Each type has distinct applications depending on surgical needs.</p></p>
