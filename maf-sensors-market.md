<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MAF Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Wire</li><li>Hot Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MAF sensors, or Mass Airflow sensors, play a crucial role in measuring the amount of air entering an engine for optimal fuel injection. The market primarily comprises two types: hot wire and hot film sensors. Hot wire MAF sensors utilize a thin wire heated electrically; as air flows over it, the cooling effect changes its resistance, providing airflow measurement. Hot film sensors, on the other hand, use a thin film element to achieve the same purpose, offering improved durability and responsiveness in various driving conditions.</p></p>
