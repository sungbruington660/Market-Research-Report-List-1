<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distress Flare Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Localisation System Type</li><li>Without Localisation System Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The distress flare market is categorized into two types based on localization systems. Flares with a localization system incorporate GPS or radio signals to transmit the user's exact location during emergencies, enhancing rescue efficiency. These are ideal for remote or maritime environments. Flares without a localization system rely solely on visual or auditory signals, making them simpler and more cost-effective but less precise in pinpointing the user's location. Both types serve critical roles in emergency signaling, catering to different needs and budgets.</p></p>
